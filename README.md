## **Backdot** – Your Intelligent Periodic Table Assistant

## Introduction
This is a simple C program that acts as an interactive guessing game. The program asks the user a series of yes/no questions to determine which chemical element they are thinking of. It follows a structured approach based on the periodic table to analyze user responses and guess the correct element.

## Features
- Interactive question-based guessing mechanism
- Uses logical branching to narrow down element choices
- Covers elements from Period 1 and Period 2 of the periodic table
- Ensures user input validation to avoid incorrect responses

## How It Works
1. The user selects a random element in their mind.
2. The program asks a series of yes/no questions about the element’s properties (e.g., period, atomic mass, group classification).
3. Based on the user’s answers, the program deduces and displays the correct element.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

### Compilation & Execution
```bash
gcc element_guessing_game.c -o element_game
./element_game
```

## Game Rules
- Answer each question with `1` (Yes) or `0` (No).
- Keep a periodic table handy for reference.
- The game follows logical steps to ensure accurate guessing.

## Example Usage
```
Lets play a game

Here at first, you will hold a random element in your mind. Then, I will try
to guess the element by asking you some questions. The questions will carry
an answer of either 'Yes' or 'No'. So, let's see if I can guess the correct element
through the expertise questions.

Press 1 if your answer is 'YES'
and type 0 if the answer is 'NO'

Don't forget to sit with a Periodic table

Here goes the first question:
Is the element located in 'Period' 1?
Your Answer: 1
I see your element is in 'Period 1'

Does it have a single Proton in its Nucleus?
Your Answer: 1
The element is Hydrogen.
```

## Future Improvements
- Extend support for elements beyond Period 2.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Optimize question flow for improved efficiency.
